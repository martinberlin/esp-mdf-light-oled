# ESP32-MeshKit-Light

## Overview

ESP32-MeshKit-Light is a smart lighting solution based on [ESP-MESH](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/mesh.html). It features network configuration, upgrade, local control, device association, etc., and will facilitate your understanding of ESP-MESH to implement further development. Before running this example, please refer to [ESP32-MeshKit Guide](../README.md).

Martin Fork: I started this repository as my humble attempt to start coding directly in ESP-IDF as a framework instead of using the Arduino Framework. As a background note, I started designing and 3D-printing my own LED Lamps and at the same time I started a [Mesh Light project in hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/163672-esp32-meshkit-unexpensive-rgb-led-lamps) 
KEEP IN MIND: That I'm using a Heltec WiFi32 for this example that has a 26Mhz crystal instead of a 40Mhz so in the menuconfig is configurable like this:

    $ make menuconfig:
    Components -> ESP32-Specific -> Main XTAL frequency -> 26 Mhz for this boards or 40 Mhz for others (Wemos, etc)


> Note: This example is not limited to ESP32-MeshKit-Light, and can also be applied to an ESP32 module connected to an external LED.


## Hardware

[ESP32-MeshKit-Light](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-meshkit-light_user_guide_en.pdf) supports 5 types of PWM IO interfaces. Its color temperature (CW) and color hue (RGB) can be adjusted, with an output power of 9 W and 3.5 W respectively.

## Light Color Change in Different Statuses

1. Wait be to networked: flashes yellow

2. Verify network configuration information: flashes orange

3. Networked successfully: flashes green

4. Start to upgrade: flashes light blue for 3 seconds

5. Upgrade successfully, ready to reboot: flashes blue

6. Abnormal reboot: flashes red

> Note: The device can be reset by powering it off/on for three consecutive times.
